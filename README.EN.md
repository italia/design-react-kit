## Intro

**Design React kit** is a set of React components that implements [Bootstrap Italia](https://italia.github.io/bootstrap-italia/) and [Design UI Kit](https://github.com/italia/design-ui-kit) styling, as [shown on InVision](https://invis.io/TWMUZS6VFP5).

Components are showcased with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

Public version of Storybook is available [here](https://italia.github.io/design-react-kit) for the latest stable release, while [here](https://design-react-kit.vercel.app/) for the current development version built from `master` branch.

### Requirements

* NodeJS
* Yarn

## Usage

To use Design React as a dependency in your React project you can install it from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~italia). We suggest to use `create-react-app` to create a new React webapp from scratch as follows:

```sh
$ create-react-app nome-app
$ cd nome-app
$ yarn add design-react-kit --save
```

## Add bootstrap-italia and fonts

The `design-react-kit` module does not include the CSS and font files in the bundle, so this needs to be installed as well:

```sh
$ yarn add bootstrap-italia typeface-lora typeface-roboto-mono typeface-titillium-web --save
```

## App.js

Then, you just need to import CSS e font editing `./src/App.js` as shown:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import { Alert } from 'design-react-kit';
import 'bootstrap-italia/dist/css/bootstrap-italia.min.css';
import 'typeface-titillium-web';
import 'typeface-roboto-mono';
import 'typeface-lora';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <Alert>This is an Alert</Alert>
    );
};

export default App;
```

#### Loading Fonts

The Bootstrap Italia theme defines a specific set of font typefaces to work: `titillium-web`, `roboto-mono` and `lora`. The loading of this set of fonts can be left to the browser or controlled: in this last case it is necessary to use the `FontLoader` component exported by the library.
Declaring the `FontLoader` on top of the Application tree it is enough to trigger the loading of the fonts.

As alternative it is required to manually manage the loading via the `webfontloader` package:

```js
const WebFont = require('webfontloader')
WebFont.load({
    custom: {
        families: [
          'Titillium Web:300,400,600,700:latin-ext',
          'Lora:400,700:latin-ext',
          'Roboto Mono:400,700:latin-ext'
        ]
    }
})
```

### Peer dependencies

The library does not include `react` and `react-dom`, avoiding versions clashing and increasing the size of the bundle.
For this reason, for local development it will be necessary to manually install dependencies.

The command to be executed is
```sh
$ yarn install --peers
```
or alternatively manually
```sh
$ yarn install react react-dom
```

## Compiling Storybook

Clone the repo and run `yarn` to install the dependencies.
Then run the `yarn storybook:serve` command to start the development server.

Storybook will therefore be available at http://localhost:9001/

Public version of the Storybook is available [here](https://italia.github.io/design-react-kit).

Storybook has been enriched with some `addons` that make it more talented. Check dependencies on the `package.json` file for details.

## How to create new components

This section explains how to create new components in the repository.
All components reside in the `src` directory: each component is a folder with all that is needed to make it work. 
*Storybook* stories are instead under `stories`.  
Unit tests are under the `test` folder.

i.e. the `Button` component is shown below the `src/Button` path and its structure is as follows:

```
src
    └── Button
        ├── Button.tsx
stories
    └── Button
        ├── Button.stories.mdx
        ├── Button.stories.tsx
test
    ├── Button.test.tsx
```

Some basic rules for structuring the components:

* TSX file component files use JSX syntax.
* The `.stories.tsx` files only contains examples relative to component.
* The `.stories.mdx` files only contains documentation relative to component.
* The `.test.tsx` files only contains tests relative to component.

Once you have created a new component, with its history, starting *Storybook* will be able to check that everything works as it should.

### How to contribute

To submit new content (feature or bug fixes) is required to fork the repository, starting from `master` create a new branch for the new feature: once completed the development (with tests when possible), create a PR to the original repository.

#### Snapshot tests

The testing system has been provided with a snapshot check on existing stories: this means that each story content is copied into a special file used as reference to check changes in the future. This might fail some test checks on the PR in case of new or changed stories.  
In such case it is possible to update the snapshot file with the following command:

```
yarn test -u
```

At this point create a new commit and update the PR. Make sure to check the new snapshot content whether it is in line with the changes made before pushing.

## Publishing

A command is available to reach a static version of the Storybook catalog as it can be deployed without using a webserver.

```sh
$ yarn storybook:build
```

Static pages obtained from the compilation process generate under the `storybook-static` directory.

## Building library

To build the library and add files into the `dist` folder:

```sh
$ yarn build
```

## Browsers support

The design kit follows the Guidelines for Public Services Design, within the Section [6.3.1.2.1. Supporto browser](https://docs.italia.it/italia/designers-italia/design-linee-guida-docs/it/2020.1/doc/user-interface/lo-sviluppo-di-un-interfaccia-e-i-web-kit.html#strumenti) via the package `browserslist-config-design-italia`.

## TypeScript typing definitions 

The library has been rewritten in Typescript and types are exported in the bundle.
